# Algorithm Used
```
This algorithm isn't in any particular language.
It's pseudocode, designed to be human-readable, but precise enough to be translated into computer code. 
In this case, I'm giving you the algorithm out front, so you don't have to come up with it yourself.
Usually designing the algorithm is the most difficult part
You should be able to step through the algorithm by hand to see if it works
You'll be translating this algorithm into C code.
You'll need to think about some details of C (particularly use of pointers) as you implement this code in C
The algorithm presumes there are two other functions you'll need to write:
    printArray(array) - given an array, print the values of the array in a single line for debugging purposes
    swap(a, b) - given pointers to variables a and b, swaps their values so that a contains the starting value of b and b contains the starting value of a. 
    Note that you can't return two values, so you'll need to operate on the variables directly in memory, so the swap will require use of pointers
    Don't forget the relationship between arrays and pointers. This can make your code a little easier to read and write.
